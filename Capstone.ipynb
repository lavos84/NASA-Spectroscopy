    "- The set of all frequencies with fluxes greater than 3 sigma will be called the **\"Universe.\"** \n",
    "- Each possible molecule may have some spikes at a few of the frequencies in the **Universe**.  So all the frequencies with a spike will constitute the **\"Set\"** for that molecule.\n",

This function takes the name of a molecule to be excluded and manipulates the data to account for its removal.  If the molecule being removed is not among the mandatory molecules (those included in *any* cover), then the molecule is dropped from the data_matrix dataframe and removed from the molecule_dict dictionary.

Therefore we must assign that molecules spikes to the \"Unknown\" category.  Then, molecule_dict must be updated to reflect the new changes to \"Unknown\".  Once this is complete, the molecule is removed as described above and `smallest_cover` is run again to find a new cover."

It is also worth noting how many frequency spikes are occupied by the \"Unknown\" molecule.  This could be a single molecule, but more  likely a combination of several for which data just isn't available yet.  The probable molecules are those whose weight (intensity $\\times$ flux) are a maximum for a particular frequency.
